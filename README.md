## 🚗 About Flow

Flow is a next-generation ride-sharing platform designed specifically for the Bryan/College Station community. We're revolutionizing transportation by prioritizing driver welfare, transparent pricing, and exceptional user experience.

### Our Mission

At Flow, our mission is to make transportation seamless, safe, and accessible while empowering drivers with greater flexibility and earning potential. We strive to create a driver-first platform where our partners have the tools, support, and fair compensation they deserve.

By prioritizing safety, community, and innovation, we connect riders with reliable drivers, ensuring affordability and trust in every ride. Flow isn't just about getting from point A to B – it's about building a transportation network that values and uplifts the people who make it possible.

## 🌟 What Makes Flow Different

### 💰 Transparent Pricing Model
Our transparent pricing model allows drivers to better understand their earning potential, ensuring they know exactly what they'll earn from each ride.

### 📱 Subscription-Driven Platform
With our innovative subscription model, drivers have fixed costs instead of percentage-based fees, dramatically increasing their earnings potential.

### 🏪 Driver-First Marketplace
Through our marketplace approach, we return pricing power to the people, letting demand and supply naturally determine fair rates.
